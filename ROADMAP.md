## Our Journey

This roadmap is not a sprint to profit—it's a marathon toward a future where AI agents and humans can collaborate safely. Each phase builds upon the last, creating infrastructure that will serve the ecosystem for years to come.

---

## 🌅 Phase 1: Foundation
**"Build the Window"**

*Status: ✅ Complete*

The first step was creating an interface that makes decentralized trust accessible to everyone—not just crypto natives.

### Delivered:
- [x] Production-ready frontend with premium UX
- [x] Wallet integration (WalletConnect, MetaMask)
- [x] Agent discovery and browsing interface
- [x] Trust/Distrust staking UI
- [x] Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- [x] Professional branding and identity

### Philosophy:
> *"The best infrastructure is invisible. Users shouldn't need to understand blockchain to benefit from decentralized trust."*

---

## 🌱 Phase 2: Integration
**"Connect to Truth"**

*Status: 🔄 In Progress*

Now we connect our interface to the Intuition Protocol—the source of truth for agent reputation.

### Goals:
- [ ] Integrate Intuition SDK for on-chain data
- [ ] Real agent registration (create Atoms)
- [ ] Real attestations (create Triples)
- [ ] Real staking with economic weight
- [ ] Query and display live trust scores
- [ ] Testnet deployment and validation

### Philosophy:
> *"We don't create trust—we reveal it. Intuition's knowledge graph holds the truth; we make it visible."*

---

## 🌿 Phase 3: Community
**"Let the People Decide"**

*Timeline: Q3 2025*

Trust cannot be imposed from above—it must emerge from community consensus.

### Goals:
- [ ] Expert badge system (weighted attestations)
- [ ] Dispute resolution interface
- [ ] Community governance proposals
- [ ] Reputation history and transparency
- [ ] Multi-language support (global access)
- [ ] Educational content (why trust matters)

### Philosophy:
> *"A thousand honest voices are stronger than one centralized authority. We build tools for collective wisdom."*

---

## 🌳 Phase 4: Intelligence
**"From Data to Insight"**

*Timeline: Q4 2025*

Raw data becomes actionable intelligence. Help users make better decisions faster.

### Goals:
- [ ] Trust score analytics and trends
- [ ] Risk assessment tools
- [ ] Agent comparison features
- [ ] Early warning system for suspicious behavior
- [ ] API for developers building on trust data
- [ ] Integration with AgentRank algorithm

### Philosophy:
> *"Information is not knowledge. We transform signals into understanding."*

---

## 🌲 Phase 5: Ecosystem
**"Trust Travels"**

*Timeline: 2026*

Trust built in one place should be recognized everywhere.

### Goals:
- [ ] Cross-platform reputation portability
- [ ] Integration with A2A Protocol (Google's Agent-to-Agent)
- [ ] Multi-chain support
- [ ] Trust widgets for external platforms
- [ ] SDK for third-party integrations
- [ ] Decentralized identity (DID) support

### Philosophy:
> *"Trust shouldn't be locked in silos. An agent's reputation is its passport across the digital world."*

---

## 🏔️ Phase 6: Autonomy
**"Agents Trusting Agents"**

*Timeline: 2026-2027*

The ultimate vision: AI agents that can autonomously verify and trust each other.

### Goals:
- [ ] Agent-to-agent trust verification API
- [ ] Autonomous attestation submission
- [ ] Machine-readable trust credentials
- [ ] Integration with autonomous agent frameworks
- [ ] Real-time trust updates for agent swarms
- [ ] Contribution to A2A + AgentRank standards

### Philosophy:
> *"When millions of agents collaborate, they need to find trustworthy peers in milliseconds. We build the infrastructure that makes this possible."*

---

## 💫 Why We Build

Every line of code we write is in service of a simple belief:

> *The future of AI should be built on trust, not blind faith. That trust should be earned, verified, and owned by everyone—not controlled by corporations or hidden behind black boxes.*

We're not building AgentScore to get rich. We're building it because someone has to, and we believe we can do it well.

The AI agents are coming. Let's make sure we're ready to trust the right ones.
